# cppm

A WIP game development mathematics library.

Though not exhaustively tested, this library is currently being used in my own WIP game engine project.

## Features:

 - Vectors
 - Matrices
 - Quaternions
 - Small set of utility functions (abs, pow, round, etc.)
 - Shape classes (Point2D, Rect, Sphere, etc.)
 - Shape intersection tests
 - Random number generation helper
 - Perlin noise
